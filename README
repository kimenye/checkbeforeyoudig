How to create a node.js & express app
=====================================
- Create the folder in which you want the app to run
- Run [express -t jade --sessions -c stylus] That uses jade as the template engine, stylus for css and has session support.
- Run [npm install -d] Installs the required dependancies
- Test whether the app runs with [node app.js]


Configuration
=============
This application uses node-config (https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config) for configuration management.
Configuration is stored in the config folder. For your local environment, create a copy of development.js.template and rename it
as development.js. Then you can override the settings with your local settings. You local development.js file will not be version controlled [it has been added to .gitignore]

How to run
==========
- Make sure you install the required dependencies. 
- $ npm install -d
- $ node app.js
- On your browser navigate to http://localhost:3000/home
